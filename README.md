# Pretty Quickfix windows for NeoVim

nvim-pqf makes your quickfix and location list windows look nicer, thanks to a
combination of a custom `quickfixtextfunc` function and custom syntax rules for
quickfix/location list buffers.

Without nvim-pqf, your quickfix window looks like this:

With nvim-pqf, it looks like this (colours depend on your theme of course);

## Features

- Better highlights for line and column numbers
- Highlights for the item type (error, warning, etc)
- Item types use the same signs as NeoVim's diagnostic signs
- File paths are aligned so messages always start at the same column, making
  them easier to read
- Works for both quickfix and location list windows
- Items only display the first line in case they contain multiple lines

## Requirements

- NeoVim 0.8 or newer

## Installation

First install this plugin using your plugin manager of choice. For example, when
using vim-plug use the following:

    Plug 'yorickpeterse/nvim-pqf'

Once installed, add the following Lua snippet to your `init.lua`:

    require('pqf').setup()

And that's it!

## Configuration

Each item in the quickfix list starts with a sign that indicates the type of
item, if this information is available. For example, when displaying diagnostics
an item may start with `E` for an error, and `W` for a warning.

These signs and their highlight groups are taken from the `text` and `texthl`
attributes of NeoVim's diagnostic signs.
Refer to `:h diagnostic-signs` for more information, and details on how to
override these signs.

To configure these signs, and other options, see below:

```lua
require('pqf').setup({
  signs = {
    error = 'E',
    warning = 'W',
    info = 'I',
    hint = 'H'
  },

  -- By default, only the first line of a multi line message will be shown. --
  When this is true, multiple lines will be shown for an entry, separated by a
  space
  show_multiple_lines = false,

  -- How long filenames in the quickfix are allowed to be. 0 means no limit.
  -- Filenames above this limit will be truncated from the beginning with
  `filename_truncate_prefix`.
  max_filename_length = 0,

  -- Prefix to use for truncated filenames.
  filename_truncate_prefix = '[...]',
})
```

## Tweaking the highlights

Depending on your theme, you may need to tweak the highlights used by nvim-pqf.
The following highlight groups are used:

| Group             | Use
|:------------------|:--------------------------
| `Directory`       | The file path
| `Number`          | Line and column numbers
| `DiagnosticError` | The sign for errors (if `texthl` is missing)
| `DiagnosticWarn`  | The sign for warnings (if `texthl` is missing)
| `DiagnosticInfo`  | The sign for info messages (if `texthl` is missing)
| `DiagnosticHint`  | The sign for hints (if `texthl` is missing)

Highlight groups of signs can be overridden:

```lua
require('pqf').setup({
  signs = {
    error = {
      text = 'E',
      texthl = 'DiagnosticSignError'
    }
  }
})
```
